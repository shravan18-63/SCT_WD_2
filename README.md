## 🧠 Why This Project Was Built

This project was created to **practice and demonstrate real-world JavaScript concepts** such as:

- **DOM Manipulation:** Updating the display screen dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling:** Capturing button clicks and keyboard presses to perform actions.
- **Input Parsing:** Evaluating arithmetic expressions and handling invalid inputs.
- **Error Handling:** Displaying “Error” messages without breaking the UI.
- **Functional Design:** Creating clean, modular, and reusable JavaScript code.

It’s more than just a calculator — it’s a hands-on exercise to strengthen **core frontend development skills**.
